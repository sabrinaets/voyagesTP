<p>This Android Studio project was developed as part of a university course called <strong>Mobile Apps</strong>.
  It consists of an Android application that allows users to browse and book a variety of organized trips. The app features a dynamic search system, enabling users 
  to filter trips based on criteria such as destination, price, duration, and more. Users can also view their current bookings and cancel them if needed. The users and trip options
are stored in a JSON file, while the bookings are stored in a SQLite database.</p>
